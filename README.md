# Leap Year and Day Calculator

## Week 3-4 Assignment 4_5 - NECC
## Professor Ethel Schuster
## Student Patricia Antlitz

### This program takes user input using built-in function scanf from the stdio library. Uses library string.h

##### User interactions:

- Asks the user for a date in the format Month, Day, Year (E.g., January, 28 2021).

Assignment 5 - This is a code that checks a date entered by the user in the format Month, Day Year, checks if the year is a leap year and print the corresponding day in the that year for the day entered. For example, if entered December 31 of a leap year, that day should correspond to the day 366 in that year. When entering December 31 on a non leap year, the day should correspond to 365 in that year. The challenge faced on this assignment was caused by the fact that the code developed is very long when compared to the other assignments. I believe there must be a better way to come up with the same solution but I am unaware of such way. I will research this. The if statement were very long and therefore prompt to errors. Debbuging was a big part of this code, the logic itself was doable since the instructions were pretty clear. Something else was figuring out how to come up with the right days for each day. I realized I had to add an specific number. After research, I found a chart (link included in the code) for the specific days.
